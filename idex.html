          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>I am a native Washingtonian who is taking a class to learn programing in the hopes of eventually getting a job as a developer. I am a dilligant, hard worker and I take pride in any product I create. I am always willing to learn a new skill if given the opportunity. I am also an artist of sorts and I hope to one day have the skill set necessary to program my own games and interactive stories.</p>
