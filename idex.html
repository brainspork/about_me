          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>I am a 24 years old and I aspire to have a new career in programing. I am a hard and dedicated worker and it is high time that I put my brain to work rather than my body. While I enjoy physical labor, the energy expended working 10 hour days at a meaningless job for minimum wage keeps me from doing things that I like to do. I want to be able to earn a good living while being able to save my physical energy for jiu-jitsu and other physical hobbies I have. Programing offers me an outlet for my creativity as well as my fairly logical mind. I am excited to learn more so that I can make complex programs in an effecient manner.</p>
